# Secret_Code_Translator (Beginner Project)
A simple Python program that converts normal English text into a secret code language and decodes it back. Built as part of my Python learning journey. This project helped me understand string manipulation, random character generation, and basic program structure.
If you find any errors. Feel free to sugest improvements.
Thanks
